  ## Description
  This fitness tracker was developed to allow a user to be able to view create and track daily workouts, log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercises. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track their distance traveled.
